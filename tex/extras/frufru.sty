\ProvidesPackage{frufru}[2020/02/03 1.1 Fancy separator]

% You may want to check the pgfornament package
% to create different separators as well as
% http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb32-2/tb101glister.pdf
\RequirePackage{fourier-orns}

% I bet some of these "nopagebreaks" are not needed :)

% Paragraphs do not *end* with a \parskip after themselves, they
% *begin* with a \parskip before themselves. This means that the
% \parskip length is determined by the font size of the paragraph
% that *follows* it, not the one that precedes it.
%
% We want a separator with the same space above and below it.
% However, because of \footnotesize, \baselineskip for the
% separator is smaller and, as a consequence, so is \parskip.
% We correct this by:
%
% 1. Subtracting \parskip before and after the separator, taking
%    into account the font size (this also means that the spacing
%    does not change if we are using \doublespacing);
%
% 2. Subtracting the separator's \baselineskip before it and adding
%    the \baselineskip from the surrounding text instead; this makes
%    the separator line take the same vertical space as surrounding
%    lines.
%
% 3. Adding the same amount of extra space before and after the
%    separator.
%
% While the spacing between lines will be constant, the font size
% of the separator is smaller. As a consequence, the top of the
% characters in this line will appear more distant from the
% preceding line than the rest. It is very hard to completely
% address this difference, because different lines may have
% different depths. An approximate correction using struts does
% not differ much from what we have here, and this difference
% is subtle enough to be ignored.
%
% We could also have used fontsize/selectfont to change the font
% without changing \baselineskip.
