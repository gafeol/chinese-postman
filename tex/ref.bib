abstract = {Abstract In two recent papers by C. S. Orloff (Networks, 4(1974)35–64, 147–162) general routing problems for one or more vehicles on a graph G = (N,A) are introduced and discussed. The single vehicle problem is to find an optimal tour on G, containing required subsets Q ⊆ N and R ⊆ A. We show that a proposed conversion of required nodes to required arcs is not allowed and that the problem remains polynomial complete if Q = θ. Furthermore, the proposed transformations from M vehicle to single vehicle problems are shown to be incorrect; correct transformations are presented as well.},

  abstract  = {We design a 1.49993-approximation algorithm for the metric traveling salesperson problem (TSP) for instances in which an optimal solution to the subtour linear programming relaxation is half-integral. These instances received significant attention over the last decade due to a conjecture of Schalekamp, Williamson and van Zuylen stating that half-integral LP solutions have the largest integrality gap over all fractional solutions. So, if the conjecture of Schalekamp et al. holds true, our result shows that the integrality gap of the subtour polytope is bounded away from 3/2.},
